 * <p>
 * Random Walkers, an example of Monte Carlo simulation.
 *
 * This program takes two integer command-line arguments r and trials. In each of trials independent experiments,
 * simulate a random walk until the random walker is at Manhattan distance r from the starting point.
 * Print the average number of steps.
 *
 * <p>
 * As r increases, we expect the random walker to take more and more steps. But how many more
 * steps? Use RandomWalkers.java to formulate a hypothesis as to how the average number of
 * steps grows as a function of r.
 *
 * <p>
 * Estimating an unknown quantity by generating random samples and aggregating the results is
 * an example of Monte Carlo simulationâ€”a powerful computational technique that is used
 * widely in statistical physics, computational finance, and computer graphics.
