     * The space complexity can be reduced to O(1) by considering two pointers at different speed -
     * a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast
     * pointer moves two steps at a time.
     * <p>
     * If there is no cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end and we can
     * return false in this case.
     * <p>
     * Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the slow and fast pointers are two runners racing
     * around a circle track. The fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner.
     * <p>
     * Time complexity: O(n).
     * <p>
     * Space complexity: O(1). We only use two nodes (slow and fast).
