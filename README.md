## What is it?
Here's what I plan to do for this project:

- Share programs I wrote for the course assignments (mainly from Princeton) from coursera and hopefully draw some thoughtful discussions (I will withdraw this and put it in a separate private repository, because posting assignment solutions or partial solutions in a *public* git is a violation of Coursera (and Princeton) policies.)
- Post miniature programs used to resolve practical problems I met
- List interesting program challenges and my solutions :smile:

## Wonderful cs courses from coursera
I would like to take this chance to say big thank-you to coursera, a platform that provides so many wonderful courses to learners. Also I want to say big thank-you to those instructors who spent lots of efforts to put good materials online.

Especially, big big thank-you to Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne from Princeton. Both of them are so generous by providing such wonderful cs courses online for free. The width and depth of their knowledge really impressed and benefited me in many ways. By completing assignements one after another, I built up the confidence on my programming skills, and of course, enjoyed a lot from writing code.

Below are the list of courses I've completed.

- [programming with a purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java) from Princeton University, grades achieved 99.3%
- [algorithm part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/) from Princeton University, grades achieved 100.0%
- [algorithm part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) from Princeton University, grades achieved 98.4%
- [computer science algorithms theory and machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines) from Princeton University, grades achieved 100%
- [python programming: a concise introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming-introduction) from Wesleyan University, grades achieved 100.0%
- [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from Stanford University, grades achieved 99.2%


Below are the list of courses in progress.

- [Object-Oriented Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design/) from Alberta University
- [Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analysis-of-algorithms/) from Princeton University
- [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/) from Hebrew University of Jerusalem


## The Beauty of Programming
[The words from Linus Torvalds](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/beautyOfProgramming.pdf) well explained what is the beauty of programming. As he puts at the end of his writing "It's still hard to explain what can be so fascinating about beating your head against the wall for three days, not knowing how to solve something the better way, the beautiful way. But once you find that way, it's the greatest feeling in the world."

I would say I have felt the same when I managed to complete those challenging assignments from Princeton courses within timelines and earned good scores by trying to achieve both time and space efficiencies. 

Writing simple, neat and elegant code with well designed data structures and algorithms. 
That's the beauty of programming, which brings tremendous joys to whose who craft that programs.


## A bit about myself
I earned master degree from UC Santa Cruz, then started the career as the software engineer at Cisco, and later promoted to team lead. But then, I was distracted with the interests on the business side. 

At that point, I am not satisfied as being an engineer or engineering lead, and wanted to know the business logic behind the engineering decisions. So went back to B-school and studied the topics such as finance, marketing, economics... After B school, I got into the investment bank doing the financial models. 

Then and now, doing data analytics using SQL, Python and machine learning techniques at e-commerce company. Actually, the latest experience prompted me to refresh myself with the knowledge of data structure, algorithms and more computer related topics. 

And gradually, I found that I am still an engineer after all these years, and engineering DNA is deep in my body. I still love programming, and enjoy the intellectual challenges brought by the design of simple and elegant algorithms.

I certainly know the difficulty of being accepted as a programmer for a middle-aged 'young' man in the workplace culture where I am. But who cares about those cliches?! Dr. King once said, 'The time is always right to do what is right'. This is my life, and I only have one. As Steve Jobs addressed, 'Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do
what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do...... And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. ......Stay hungry, stay foolish'. 

Hopefully this motivates you as well.
